Category: I would categorize the customer query as "Technical". 

The query is related to a specific issue with a product (Samsung S25's camera) and the customer is seeking assistance to resolve the problem, which falls under technical support.
Sentiment: The sentiment of this customer query is 'Negative'. The customer is experiencing an issue with their Samsung S25's camera and is seeking help to resolve the problem, indicating frustration or dissatisfaction with the product's performance.
Response: I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue with your Samsung S25's camera. Here are some general steps you can try to recover your camera:

1. **Restart your phone**: Sometimes, a simple reboot can resolve the issue. Press and hold the power button until your phone shuts down, then turn it back on.
2. **Check for software updates**: Ensure your phone's software is up to date, as newer versions may include camera improvements or bug fixes. Go to Settings > Software update > Download and install.
3. **Clean the camera lens**: Dirt, dust, or moisture on the camera lens can cause issues. Use a soft cloth to gently wipe the lens clean.
4. **Check camera settings**: Ensure the camera app is set to the correct mode (e.g., Auto, Pro, or Portrait). You can also try resetting the camera settings to their default values.
5. **Disable and re-enable the camera**: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Disable, then enable it again.
6. **Clear camera app cache**: Go to Settings > Apps > Camera > Storage > Clear cache.
7. **Check for physical damage**: Inspect the camera lens and surrounding area for any signs of physical damage, such as cracks or water damage.
8. **Try a different camera app**: Download and install a third-party camera app, such as Google Camera or Open Camera, to see if the issue is specific to the Samsung camera app.
9. **Reset your phone to its factory settings**: If none of the above steps work, you can try resetting your phone to its factory settings. This will erase all data, so be sure to back up your important files before doing so.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it's possible that there's a hardware problem with your phone's camera. In this case, you may need to contact Samsung support or visit a Samsung authorized service center for further assistance.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
